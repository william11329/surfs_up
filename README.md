# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
This projects purpose was to analyze and present summary statistics of temperature for the months of June and December. The data was needed to determine if a surf/ice cream shop would thrive as a year round buisness or if it could only exist as a
seasonal one. 

## Results: 

- keeping in mind the count for december is lower than june, the data shows that the difference in average temperature is only 4 degrees, and the difference in max temperature is only 2 degrees.
- Our graph for december specifically shows the median temperature is closer to our average, and also less outliers to sku our average.
- Our station temps recorded show that depending on the location, temperatures may be very similar or up to a 10 degree difference in 
- june/july.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Based solely on the data analyzed it would seem that opening an ice cream/surf shop year round would be extremely viable. The data shows that the average temperature between months is only 4 degrees. The best evidence to contribute to my summary is that the median temp for december, having the highest frequency recorded, is just about 72 degrees which is near double the next highest, 75. Based on these temperature conditions it would seem that pairing an ice cream shop year round could be very profitable.

### Additional data
It's my opinion that before any final decision is made more data should be collected and alayzed. One query I would suggest is to observe the station data, it shows the island temps can vary quite a bit based on location. Secondly it would be in your best interest to check weather conditions for the best surfing weather. Rain, and wind could potentially deter people from surfing, cause less customer traffic in general, or possibly even cause dangerous conditions for the store.
